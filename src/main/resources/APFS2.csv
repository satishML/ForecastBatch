As a DHS component, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Finance Center (FINCEN) located in Chesapeake, VA became the financial processing, accounting, and reporting service provider for both the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) which are also components within DHS.  The USCG’s financial management functions operate in a strategic environment that has changed dramatically in recent years.  These changes have significantly impacted the requirements which govern the way the USCG now conducts financial management activities.TSA and DNDO rely on the FINCEN to provide accurate financial reports in an efficient and effective manner. In FY16, DNDO was the first of the three agencies that transferred to the Department of Interior-Interior Business Center’s (DOI IBC) Oracle R12 business solution (information technology services) while the FINCEN continued to retain responsibility for accounting and processing payments for the DNDO.

The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel to provide support for the following areas:Acquisition and DeploymentThis area involves CRBN acquisition activities required to obtain, test and field systems identified by the Acquisition Directorate as necessary to fill material and non-material gaps in sensor and detection architecture for DHS components.Test and Evaluation (T&E) CWMD’s research, development, and acquisition process is anchored by rigorous assessments of mission-related technologies as they are developed and deployed.  Through the T&E JPA, these technologies are supported by test and evaluation (T&E) campaigns to characterize, verify, and validate technical performance and assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of technologies under development, as well as that of commercially available systems prior to deployment.  Rigorous and scientifically defensible testing requires a team of trained and experienced subject matter experts, including nuclear physicists, statisticians, analysts, and testers.  CWMD utilizes test instrumentation and automated data collection systems to enable its test teams to rapidly verify and validate data, thus ensuring that analysts have quality data sets.  Note: There should be a firewall between the support that T&E receives and the support that is received by ACQ, RDE, and RCO to maintain T&E’s independence.Research and DevelopmentCWMD conducts, supports, and coordinates an aggressive research and development (R&D) program to address significant architectural and technical challenges unresolved by current capability on the near horizon. This includes the development of break-through technologies that will have a clear and demonstrable positive impact on the ability to detect WMD threats as well as enhance the forensic examination of pre-detonation materials. These programs partner with industry, national laboratories and academia to improve performance while reducing costs and operational burdens of detectors and sensor systems and strengthen the nuclear forensics capability in technology advancement and expertise development.

F2019046298,"In order to maintain long haul high frequency (HF) communications aboard certain classes of cutters and shore side communications facilities, the United States Coast Guard’s Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN) has a requirement to replace three HF radio transceiver systems that are at end of life: the Thales TMR-90, Sunair RT-9000B, and the Rockwell Collins RT-2200 systems. C3CEN also has a requirement to replace the Harris R-2368 HF receiver system that too is at end of life. The age of the systems, lack of availability of spare parts and inability repair key subcomponents makes continuing support and maintaining operational availabilities infeasible. This replacement effort requires a commercially available HF radio system comprised of various numbers of HF transceivers, receivers, remote control units, 4 kW amplifiers, 1kW amplifiers, 500W amplifiers, 125W/150W amplifiers, antenna tuning units, and power supplies, where exact quantities depend on the operational requirements of the unit class.

The increased data rates provided by wideband HF improves reliability and provides an alternative to satellite communications for the ability to pass data.The system must also be compatible with existing antennas to include both ship and shore antenna infrastructure. Ship infrastructure includes the whip antenna and near vertical incident skywave (NVIS) antenna. Shore antennas are predominantly horizontally arrays and all require a 50? transceiver output. Not all shore antennas are grounded or use ground planes.
