The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel to provide support for the following areas:Acquisition and DeploymentThis area involves CRBN acquisition activities required to obtain, test and field systems identified by the Acquisition Directorate as necessary to fill material and non-material gaps in sensor and detection architecture for DHS components.Test and Evaluation (T&E) CWMD’s research, development, and acquisition process is anchored by rigorous assessments of mission-related technologies as they are developed and deployed.  Through the T&E JPA, these technologies are supported by test and evaluation (T&E) campaigns to characterize, verify, and validate technical performance and assess the operational effectiveness and suitability of technologies under development, as well as that of commercially available systems prior to deployment.  Rigorous and scientifically defensible testing requires a team of trained and experienced subject matter experts, including nuclear physicists, statisticians, analysts, and testers.  CWMD utilizes test instrumentation and automated data collection systems to enable its test teams to rapidly verify and validate data, thus ensuring that analysts have quality data sets.  Note: There should be a firewall between the support that T&E receives and the support that is received by ACQ, RDE, and RCO to maintain T&E’s independence.Research and DevelopmentCWMD conducts, supports, and coordinates an aggressive research and development (R&D) program to address significant architectural and technical challenges unresolved by current capability on the near horizon. This includes the development of break-through technologies that will have a clear and demonstrable positive impact on the ability to detect WMD threats as well as enhance the forensic examination of pre-detonation materials. These programs partner with industry, national laboratories and academia to improve performance while reducing costs and operational burdens of detectors and sensor systems and strengthen the nuclear forensics capability in technology advancement and expertise development.  Front Office SupportActivities include but are not limited to, supporting the day-to-day management and execution of the functions of the CWMD front office, ensuring execution complies with DHS/CWMD policies and in support of the Assistant Secretary’s strategic vision, adequate coordination of CWMD issues and matters, and timely completion and execution of assigned tasks.Planned Vehicle: Small Business set aside under GSA FSS PSSDraft RFP to be released on or about 9/17/2019.

F2020049381,"The BUILDER™ SMS is a web-based software application developed by the Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center’s Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) to help civil engineers, technicians, and managers decide when, where, and how to best sustain building infrastructure.  For building assets that are vast and diverse, a knowledge-based philosophy drives the BUILDER™ SMS process. The process initiates with an automated download of real property data. Subsequently, a more detailed system inventory is modeled and/or collected that identifies components and key life-cycle attributes, including the age and material type. From this inventory, the Condition Index (CI) measures for each component are predicted based on its expected stage in the life-cycle. Objective and repeatable inspections can then be performed on various components to verify their condition with respect to the expected life-cycle deterioration.  This multi-phase project aims to create a United States Coast Guard (USCG) BUILDER™ SMS Program to enable better informed capital and depot level planning decisions.  This project includes the development of a BUILDER™ SMS implementation plan including business rules and guiding documents, follow-on proof-of-concept prototyping, on-site training and development of training tools, and quality assurance and helpdesk support during field implementation.",NEW,USCG/SILC-Const.
